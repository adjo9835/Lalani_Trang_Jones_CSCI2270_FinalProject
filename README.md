# Lalani_Trang_Jones_CSCI2270_FinalProject
The final project for CSCI2270: Data Structures. Created by Faisal M. Lalani, Adam Jones, and Phi Trang.

Description of Project

QuizMe is a program that allows you to quiz yourself through virtual flashcards. You can add, delete, and edit cards, while also have the obvious ability of testing yourself through the flashcards. Additional features such as a timer (to see how quickly you can answer a card) and a confidence meter (the more confident cards will appear less) may be added (depends on time). Enjoy.
